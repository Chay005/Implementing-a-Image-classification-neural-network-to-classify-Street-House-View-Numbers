# Image-Classification
# Problem Statement
The objective of the project is to implement a simple image classification based on the k-Nearest Neighbour and a deep neural network.

# Dataset Description
SVHN is a real-world image dataset for developing machine learning and object recognition algorithms with minimal requirement on data formatting but comes from a significantly harder, unsolved, real world problem (recognizing digits and numbers in natural scene images). SVHN is obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images.
